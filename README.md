# About this branch

本專案承 [od2016](https://github.com/od2016/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.zhTW.md) 之正體中文翻譯成果，試圖持續將 OAS 3.0 文件更通順地表達，寫作風格將盡量依循 [中文文案排版指北](https://github.com/sparanoid/chinese-copywriting-guidelines) 。由於文字頗多，如您願意幫忙，請聯絡 isacl \[AT\] unisharp.com，或是直接到本文的[工作區 (hackmd)](https://hackmd.io/GwMwJgTAHARmCmBaAhgZmAdkQFjKpyyoiArAJz4TLwAMIqIAjEA=)中共筆（我應該可以由 hackmd hisotry 中整理出貢獻者）。本譯文新的參考原文為 [OAS 3.0.0-rc2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.md#path-templating)，因此在校稿的過程中也會持續將 rc2 的差異補上。


# The OpenAPI Specification

This is the working branch for the next version of the OpenAPI Specification. You can read more about the Open API Initiative (OAI) at [https://openapis.org](https://openapis.org).

The current, released version of the OpenAPI Specification is 2.0, through donation of the Swagger Specification to the OAI by SmartBear Software.  If you are interested in the release specification, please see the [master branch](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/README.md) of this project.

Development of the next version of the OpenAPI Specification is being guided by the [OAI Technical Contributors Board](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/CONTRIBUTORS.md).  This group of committers will be bring their API expertise, incorporating feedback from the community, and expanding the group of committers as appropriate.  All development activity on the future specification will be performed as features and merged into this branch.  Upon release of the OpenAPI Specification, this branch will be merged to master.

You can see the current process for development inside the OpenAPI Specification [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/DEVELOPMENT.md).

## Participation

The OpenAPI Specification is a community driven, open project hosted by the Linux Foundation. The OAI encourages participation from individuals and companies alike. If you wish to participate in the evolution of the OpenAPI Specification, please consider the following:

* Review the [current specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/versions/3.0.md). The human-readable markdown file _is the source of truth_ for the specification.
* Review the [development](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/OpenAPI.next/DEVELOPMENT.md) process so it's clear how the spec is evolving.
* Check the [issues](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues) and [pull requests](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/pulls) to see if someone has already documented your idea or feedback on the specification. You can follow an existing conversation by adding a comment to the existing issue or PR.
* Create an issue to describe a new concern along with, if possible, a proposed solution.

Be aware that not all feedback can be accommodated and there may be solid arguments to/from a change being appropriate for the specification.
